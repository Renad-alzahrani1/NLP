NLP Project

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that involves data preprocessing, exploration, and classification using machine learning models.

Project Overview

The project demonstrates the following key steps:

1. Data Exploration:Understanding the structure and nature of the dataset.
2. Data Representation: Representing textual data for analysis.
3. Text Preprocessing:
   - Removing stop words.
   - Tokenization.
   - Stemming.
   - Converting labels to numerical representations.
4. Feature Engineering:
   - Creating a Bag of Words (BoW) representation of the text data.
5. Model Building:
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
   - Training and evaluating models including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Multinomial Naive Bayes

Results

- Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 63%.
- Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier achieved an accuracy of 61%.
